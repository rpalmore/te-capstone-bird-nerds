Boost your pandemic bird-watching hobby by keeping tabs on who's visiting your feeder and neighborhood. Register for the app to create a user profile, lists of feathered friends and details about their activity, and upload photos (your own or fair-use images from the web). Unregistered visitors can browse pictures of recent sightings logged by Bird Nerds in specific zip codes.

This project was conceived by Ashley Hoffman and developed by Hoffman, Noah Griffin, Amy Pfaff and myself to mark our completion of Tech Elevator's 14-week full-stack bootcamp in February 2022. Hooray!

We used Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Vue.js, Vue Router, Vuex, JavaScript, CSS and HTML to build Bird Nerds over the course of 10 days. We followed the MVC design pattern and agile SDLC methodology.

I have continued developing Bird Nerds on my own, adding a photo upload tool (Cloudinary) and responsive design. Updated styling throughout the app (for better or worse) reflects my design aesthetic and might not represent the preferences of the team at large.

Some starter code was provided for this application, including authentication, registration and login functionality and a basic database setup for us to build on.

Finally, a warm thank you to our awesome instructors Margaret Green, Gregor Dzierzon (our intrepid product owner) and Andy Chong Sam (our ever-inquisitive scrum master) for their support, along with Tech Elevator superstar (and academic fellow) Joe Righetti, who we tried our best to stump along the way.
